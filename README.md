# G-PHP

G-PHP is a Backend-as-a-Service(BaaS) designed for those who don't want to pay for 3rd party servers and want to host on their cPanel or any Apache server. The purpose of developing this to speed up my development for mobile apps / angular apps for storing data to the database. Consider this a simple and lite version of firebase or parse server.

# Features!

  - Manage Applications.
  - Domain & IP whitelisting for application api requests.
  - Stats for application api requests usages.
  - table-based data storage using MySQL.

### Tech

G-PHP uses PHP 7.3 & MySql.


### Installation

G-PHP designed to use with ease no complicated installation is required. Just copy all the files and folder to your htdocs/public folder and copy the .htaccess file on your site root folder and then create an empty MySQL database and create a user with all the permission for the database.

After that, open the config.php and change the MySQL database details and that's it!
